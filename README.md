### Description 📚

Whenever someone dies, they are sent to Bar Quindecim run by Decim - owner of the bar, serving as arbiter, he decides the further fate of the guest's soul : gives verdict whether the guest's soul will be banished into the void or will it acquire a new body. Arbiter leads inside a tower on the 15th floor in the afterlife with bartender Kurokami no Onna, who serves guests and workers. Besides arbiter and bartender in Quindecim works assistent Quin – she prepares guests' life description ( as known as prehistory ) prior to their death and hand information over to the arbiter before guests arrive at the bar, each guest has id, name, the cause of death and in addition their date of birth.

After guests arrive at the bar, the arbiter offers to play a game for them, guests, not realizing that they have already died, agree in the hope of getting out of the strange place as soon as possible. One of the guests presses the button in the table and randomly one game for two falls out. Guests enter prepared room and begin to play. During game people's darkest sides, what were previously deep inside, come out. After game regardless of who won and who lost ( the game itself is needed only to bring people to their true selves ) the arbiter gives verdict based on the guests' prehistories and their behavior during the game.

Quindecim offers different sorts of drinks and snacks. At the bar desk are both non-alcoholic drink and alcoholic beverages, each type has many various kinds. As an instance, abstinents can choose between still or sparkling water, fizzy drinks and non-alcoholic cocktaills.

### Loop discussion 🔁


Workers are allowed to drink and eat at the workplace. In this regard, the bartender, in addition to serving guests, is also engaged in serving workers. The bartender can also order and serve herself.

Arbiter, being a worker, is at the same time the owner of the bar, that is, he performs two duties: he is the arbiter and the owner. The position of the owner allows him to have connection owns the bar, that is he owns the bar in which he works. The rest of the workers are not owners, they only work in the bar.

Arbiter gives verdict to the guest after the game. Guests who have received a verdict can no longer make orders.

Guest, for whom the assistent has prepared prehistory, can make orders; there cannot be a case where guest does not have prehistory.
