# Machine Learning Applications for Psinder

This document outlines potential machine learning applications that could be built on top of the Psinder database schema. These applications showcase how the current data model can support advanced AI/ML features.

## 1. Pet Matching Recommendation System

### Overview
A recommendation system that suggests potential pet matches based on historical like/match patterns and profile attributes.

### Implementation Approach
- **Model Type**: Collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation system
- **Features**: See `analytics/recommendation_features.sql` for extracted features
- **Target Variable**: Match success (binary: match/no match)

### Training Process
1. Extract features from the database using the SQL query
2. Split data into training/validation sets
3. Train models (e.g., Matrix Factorization, LightGBM, Neural Networks)
4. Evaluate using metrics like precision@k, recall@k, and user engagement

### Deployment
The model could be integrated into the application to:
- Rank potential matches in users' feeds
- Suggest "Top Picks" of the day
- Provide insights like "Popular with similar pets"

## 2. User Engagement Prediction

### Overview
Predict which users are likely to become inactive and implement retention strategies.

### Implementation Approach
- **Model Type**: Classification (logistic regression, random forest)
- **Features**:
  - Profile completeness (photos, description length)
  - Activity patterns (login frequency, time spent)
  - Interaction metrics (likes sent/received, messages)
- **Target Variable**: User churn (inactive for X days)

### Application
- Send personalized notifications to at-risk users
- Offer incentives to increase engagement
- Optimize the onboarding experience

## 3. Message Response Prediction

### Overview
Predict the likelihood of response to messages between matched users.

### Implementation Approach
- **Model Type**: NLP-based classification model
- **Features**:
  - Message content (length, sentiment, topics)
  - User similarity metrics
  - Time of day, day of week
  - Previous conversation engagement
- **Target Variable**: Message response (yes/no)

### Application
- Suggest message templates with high response rates
- Provide writing suggestions
- Optimize notification timing

## 4. User Preference Mining

### Overview
Discover implicit preferences that aren't explicitly stated in user profiles.

### Implementation Approach
- **Model Type**: Association rule mining, clustering
- **Data Sources**: Like patterns, matches, messaging behavior
- **Output**: Discovered preference rules

### Application
- Enhance matching algorithm with discovered preferences
- Improve user preference input forms
- Create more accurate user segments for analytics

## 5. Visual Feature Extraction for Photos

### Overview
Extract visual features from pet photos to improve matching and engagement.

### Implementation Approach
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Features**:
  - Pet breed classification
  - Image quality assessment
  - Pet emotion recognition
- **Integration**: Store extracted features in the database

### Application
- Improve photo recommendations ("Use this as your primary photo")
- Filter low-quality images automatically
- Match based on visual similarity

## Technical Requirements

To implement these ML applications, the database would need to be extended with:

1. **Feature Storage**: New tables to store pre-computed features
2. **Model Results**: Tables to store model predictions and recommendations
3. **Feedback Loop**: Tracking of user interactions with ML-generated recommendations
4. **A/B Testing**: Framework to compare algorithm versions

## Next Steps

1. Start with the recommendation system as the core ML feature
2. Implement basic analytics pipeline to extract features
3. Develop a simple model prototype and evaluate performance
4. Gradually add more sophisticated ML features based on user feedback
