# Data Engineering Aspects of Psinder

This document highlights the Data Engineering aspects of the Psinder project, which can be valuable for showcasing your skills to potential employers in the ML/Data Engineering field.

## ETL Pipeline

The project includes a sophisticated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in `etl.sql` that:

1. **Extracts** raw data from multiple tables in the database
2. **Transforms** the data by:
   - Calculating metrics like match rates and engagement statistics
   - Cleaning and standardizing values
   - Computing derived fields (like ages from birth dates)
   - Creating aggregations (counts of likes, matches, etc.)
3. **Loads** the transformed data into a denormalized format suitable for analytics

This ETL query can be scheduled to run periodically to update an analytics database or data warehouse.

## Data Modeling

The database demonstrates solid data modeling principles:

- **Normalized Schema**: The core tables follow normalization principles to reduce redundancy
- **Junction Tables**: Many-to-many relationships are properly modeled with junction tables
- **Indexing Strategy**: Appropriate indexes are created to optimize query performance
- **Constraints**: Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## Triggers and Automation

The project uses database triggers to automate business processes:

- Automatic match creation when two users like each other
- Automatic conversation creation when a match is formed

This shows understanding of event-driven data processing.

## Analytics-Ready Design

The schema is designed with analytics in mind:

- Timestamps on key events (profile creation, likes, matches, messages)
- User activity tracking
- Dimensional data (location, demographics, pet types/breeds)

## Data Quality and Integrity

The project implements several measures to ensure data quality:

- Primary and foreign key constraints
- Not null constraints on critical fields
- Default values where appropriate
- Consistent use of data types

## Potential Extensions for ML/AI Engineering

To further demonstrate ML/AI Engineering capabilities, consider adding:

1. **Recommendation Engine**: SQL queries that could power a pet recommendation system
2. **Feature Engineering**: Queries that extract features for ML models
3. **A/B Testing**: Database design to support A/B testing of matching algorithms
4. **ML Model Integration**: Examples of how ML model results could be stored and used

## Further Data Engineering Improvements

Potential improvements to showcase more advanced data engineering skills:

1. **Data Partitioning**: Strategy for partitioning large tables like messages
2. **Data Archiving**: Approach for archiving old/inactive data
3. **Materialized Views**: For frequently accessed analytics queries
4. **Data Pipeline**: Scripts to automate the ETL process using tools like Airflow
